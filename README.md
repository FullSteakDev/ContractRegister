# ContractRegister

This java project was made in a group of two people. We used MySQL database to store the users, signees, contracts informations.

After the admin login we are able to create a signee or contract or to remove one based on ID. There is also a possibility to list them.

There is an opportunity to create a user account. After the login the user can only list the contracts because she/he does not have the rights to modify the datas.
