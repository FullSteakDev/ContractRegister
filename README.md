# ContractRegister

This java project was made in a two person group with my mate. We used MySQL database to store the users, signees, contracts informations.

After the admin login we are able to create a signee or contract or to remove one based on ID. There is also a possibility to list them.

There is an opportunity to create a user account, and after that log in with the credentials, but from that point the user can only list the contracts because she/he does not have the rights to modify the datas.
